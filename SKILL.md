  Self-improving memory architecture for OpenClaw agents. Structured memory files,
  nightly distillation, weekly synthesis, and enforced principles — so your agent
  compounds knowledge instead of forgetting it. Includes opt-in metrics tracking with
  growth charts and compound scoring to measure effectiveness over time. All sensitive features (voice profiling,
  infrastructure auto-collection, git push) are OFF by default and require explicit
  opt-in via environment variable or flag. Safe to install: no network calls during
  setup, fully auditable bash scripts, isolated cron sessions scoped to workspace only.
  Use when: (1) setting up a new OpenClaw instance, (2) user asks to improve/organize
  memory, (3) user wants the agent to stop forgetting things, (4) bootstrapping a fresh
  agent with best practices. NOT for: runtime memory_search queries (use built-in memory
  tools). Triggers: "set up memory", "organize yourself", "stop forgetting", "memory
  architecture", "self-improving", "cortex", "bootstrap memory", "memory optimization".

# OpenCortex — Self-Improving Memory Architecture

Transform a default OpenClaw agent into one that compounds knowledge daily.

📦 [Full source on GitHub](https://github.com/JD2005L/opencortex) — review the code, file issues, or contribute.

## What This Does

1. **Structures memory** into purpose-specific files instead of one flat dump
2. **Installs nightly maintenance** that distills daily work into permanent knowledge
3. **Installs weekly synthesis** that catches patterns across days
4. **Establishes principles** that enforce good memory habits — and backs them up with nightly audits that verify tool documentation, decision capture, sub-agent debriefs, failure analysis, and unnecessary deferrals to the user. Nothing slips through the cracks.
6. **Builds a voice profile** of your human from daily conversations for authentic ghostwriting (opt-in, requires `OPENCORTEX_VOICE_PROFILE=1`)
7. **Encrypts sensitive data** in an AES-256 vault with key-only references in docs; supports passphrase rotation (`vault.sh rotate`) and validates key names on `vault.sh set`
8. **Enables safe git backup** with secret scrubbing (secrets never modified in your live workspace — scrubbed in an isolated copy only)
9. **Tracks growth over time** *(opt-in)* — daily metrics snapshots with compound scoring and ASCII growth charts

## Installation

**Prerequisites** (install these separately if you don't have them):
- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) 2026.2.x+
- [ClawHub CLI](https://clawhub.com)

```bash
# 1. Download the skill from your OpenClaw workspace directory
cd ~/clawd    # or wherever your workspace is
clawhub install opencortex

# 2. Run the installer FROM YOUR WORKSPACE DIRECTORY (not from inside the skill folder)
bash skills/opencortex/scripts/install.sh

# Optional: preview what would be created without changing anything
bash skills/opencortex/scripts/install.sh --dry-run
```

The installer will ask about optional features (encrypted vault, voice profiling, infrastructure collection, git backup). It's safe to re-run — it skips anything that already exists. The installer itself makes no network calls — it only creates local files and registers cron jobs.

```bash
# 3. Verify everything is working (read-only — checks files and cron jobs, changes nothing)
bash skills/opencortex/scripts/verify.sh
```

You can also ask your OpenClaw agent "is OpenCortex working?" — it knows how to run the verification and share results.

The script will:
- Create the file hierarchy (non-destructively — won't overwrite existing files)
- Create directory structure
- Set up cron jobs (daily distillation, weekly synthesis)
- Optionally set up git backup with secret scrubbing

After install, review and customize:
- `SOUL.md` — personality and identity (make it yours)
- `USER.md` — info about your human
- `MEMORY.md` — principles (add/remove as needed)
- `.secrets-map` — add your actual secrets for git scrubbing

## Updating

```bash
# 1. Download the latest version (run from workspace root)
clawhub install opencortex --force

# 2. Re-run the installer — it detects your existing install and offers to update
bash skills/opencortex/scripts/install.sh
```

The installer detects your existing version and offers three options: Update (recommended), Full reinstall, or Cancel. The update path is non-destructive — it adds missing content, refreshes cron messages, and offers any new optional features without overwriting your customized files.

## Architecture

```
SOUL.md          ← Identity, personality, boundaries
AGENTS.md        ← Operating protocol, delegation rules
MEMORY.md        ← Principles + memory index (< 3KB, loaded every session)
TOOLS.md         ← Tool shed: APIs, scripts, and access methods with abilities descriptions
INFRA.md         ← Infrastructure atlas: hosts, IPs, services, network
USER.md          ← Human's preferences, projects, communication style
BOOTSTRAP.md     ← First-run checklist for new sessions

memory/
  projects/      ← One file per project (distilled, not raw)
  contacts/      ← One file per person/org (role, context, preferences)
  workflows/     ← One file per workflow/pipeline (services, steps, issues)
  runbooks/      ← Step-by-step procedures (delegatable to sub-agents)
  preferences.md ← Cross-cutting user preferences by category
  archive/       ← Archived daily logs + weekly summaries
  YYYY-MM-DD.md  ← Today's working log (distilled nightly)
```

## Principles (installed by default)

| # | Name | Purpose |
|---|------|---------|
| P1 | Delegate First | Assess tasks for sub-agent delegation; stay available |
| P2 | Write It Down | Commit to files, not mental notes |
| P3 | Ask Before External | Confirm before emails, public posts, destructive ops |
| P4 | Tool Shed & Workflows | Document tools and workflows; enforced by nightly audit |
| P5 | Capture Decisions & Preferences | Record decisions and preferences; enforced by nightly + weekly audit |
| P6 | Sub-agent Debrief | Delegated work feeds back to daily log; orphans recovered by distillation |
| P7 | Log Failures | Tag failures/corrections; root cause analysis enforced by nightly audit |
| P8 | Check the Shed First | Consult TOOLS.md/INFRA.md/memory before deferring work to user; enforced by nightly audit |

## Cron Jobs (installed)

| Schedule | Name | What it does |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Daily 3 AM (local) | Distillation | Reads daily logs → distills into project/tools/infra files → audits tools/decisions/debriefs/failures → optimizes → archives |
| Weekly Sunday 5 AM | Synthesis | Reviews week for patterns, recurring problems, unfinished threads, decisions; auto-creates runbooks from repeated procedures |

Both jobs use a shared lockfile (`/tmp/opencortex-distill.lock`) to prevent conflicts when daily and weekly runs overlap.

Customize times by editing cron jobs: `openclaw cron list` then `openclaw cron edit <id> --cron "..."`.

## Git Backup (optional)

If enabled during install, creates:
- `scripts/git-backup.sh` — auto-commit every 6 hours, scrubs secrets in an isolated temp copy (workspace files never modified)
- `.secrets-map` — maps secrets to placeholders (gitignored, 600 perms)

Add secrets to `.secrets-map` in format: `actual_secret|{{PLACEHOLDER_NAME}}`

Before each push, `git-backup.sh` verifies no raw secrets remain in the scrubbed copy. If any are found, the backup is aborted — nothing reaches the remote.

## Customization

**Adding a project:** Create `memory/projects/my-project.md`, add to MEMORY.md index.

**Adding a contact:** Create `memory/contacts/name.md`. Distillation auto-creates contacts from conversations.

**Adding a workflow:** Create `memory/workflows/my-pipeline.md`. Distillation auto-creates workflows when described.

**Adding a preference:** Append to `memory/preferences.md` under the right category. Distillation auto-captures from conversation.

**Adding a principle:** Append to MEMORY.md under 🔴 PRINCIPLES. Keep it short.

**Adding a runbook:** Create `memory/runbooks/my-procedure.md`. Sub-agents can follow these directly.

**Adding a tool:** Add to TOOLS.md with: what it is, how to access it, and a goal-oriented abilities description (so future intent-based lookup matches).

## How It Compounds

```
Daily work → daily log
  → nightly distill → routes to project/tools/infra/principles files
                     → optimization pass (dedup, prune stale, condense)
  → weekly synthesis → patterns, recurring problems, unfinished threads → auto-creates runbooks from repeated procedures → `memory/runbooks/`
Sub-agent work → debrief (P6) → daily log → same pipeline
Decisions → captured with reasoning (P5) → never re-asked
New tools → documented with abilities (P4) → findable by intent
```

Each day the agent wakes up slightly more knowledgeable and better organized.
