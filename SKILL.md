  Self-improving memory architecture for OpenClaw agents. Transforms the default flat memory
  into a structured, self-maintaining knowledge system that grows smarter over time.
  Use when: (1) setting up a new OpenClaw instance, (2) user asks to improve/organize memory,
  (3) user wants the agent to stop forgetting things, (4) bootstrapping a fresh agent with
  best practices. NOT for: runtime memory_search queries (use built-in memory tools).
  Triggers: "set up memory", "organize yourself", "stop forgetting", "memory architecture",
  "self-improving", "cortex", "bootstrap memory", "memory optimization".

# Cortex — Self-Improving Memory Architecture

Transform a default OpenClaw agent into one that compounds knowledge daily.

## What This Does

1. **Structures memory** into purpose-specific files instead of one flat dump
2. **Installs nightly maintenance** that distills daily work into permanent knowledge
3. **Installs weekly synthesis** that catches patterns across days
4. **Establishes principles** that enforce good memory habits
5. **Enables safe git backup** with automatic secret scrubbing

## Installation

Run `scripts/install.sh` from this skill directory. It is idempotent — safe to re-run.

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh
```

The script will:
- Create the file hierarchy (non-destructively — won't overwrite existing files)
- Create directory structure
- Set up cron jobs (daily distillation, weekly synthesis)
- Optionally set up git backup with secret scrubbing

After install, review and customize:
- `SOUL.md` — personality and identity (make it yours)
- `USER.md` — info about your human
- `MEMORY.md` — principles (add/remove as needed)
- `.secrets-map` — add your actual secrets for git scrubbing

## Architecture

```
SOUL.md          ← Identity, personality, boundaries
AGENTS.md        ← Operating protocol, delegation rules
MEMORY.md        ← Principles + memory index (< 3KB, loaded every session)
TOOLS.md         ← Tool shed: APIs, credentials, scripts with abilities descriptions
INFRA.md         ← Infrastructure atlas: hosts, IPs, services, network
USER.md          ← Human's preferences, projects, communication style
BOOTSTRAP.md     ← First-run checklist for new sessions

memory/
  projects/      ← One file per project (distilled, not raw)
  runbooks/      ← Step-by-step procedures (delegatable to sub-agents)
  archive/       ← Archived daily logs + weekly summaries
  YYYY-MM-DD.md  ← Today's working log (distilled nightly)
```

## Principles (installed by default)

| # | Name | Purpose |
|---|------|---------|
| P1 | Delegate First | Assess tasks for sub-agent delegation; stay available |
| P2 | Write It Down | Commit to files, not mental notes |
| P3 | Ask Before External | Confirm before emails, public posts, destructive ops |
| P4 | Tool Shed | Document every tool/API with goal-oriented abilities description |
| P5 | Capture Decisions | Record decisions with reasoning; never re-ask |
| P6 | Sub-agent Debrief | Sub-agents write learnings to daily log before completing |

## Cron Jobs (installed)

| Schedule | Name | What it does |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Daily 3 AM (local) | Distillation | Reads daily logs → distills into project/tools/infra files → optimizes → archives |
| Weekly Sunday 5 AM | Synthesis | Reviews week for patterns, recurring problems, unfinished threads, decisions |

Customize times by editing cron jobs: `openclaw cron list` then `openclaw cron edit <id> --cron "..."`.

## Git Backup (optional)

If enabled during install, creates:
- `scripts/git-backup.sh` — auto-commit every 6 hours
- `scripts/git-scrub-secrets.sh` — replaces secrets with `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` before commit
- `scripts/git-restore-secrets.sh` — restores secrets after push
- `.secrets-map` — maps secrets to placeholders (gitignored, 600 perms)

Add secrets to `.secrets-map` in format: `actual_secret|{{PLACEHOLDER_NAME}}`

## Customization

**Adding a new project:** Create `memory/projects/my-project.md`, add to MEMORY.md index. Nightly distillation will route relevant daily log entries to it.

**Adding a new principle:** Append to MEMORY.md under 🔴 PRINCIPLES. Keep it short — one sentence proclamation.

**Adding a runbook:** Create `memory/runbooks/my-procedure.md` with step-by-step instructions. Sub-agents can follow these directly.

**Adding a tool:** Add to TOOLS.md with: what it is, how to access it, and a goal-oriented abilities description (so future intent-based lookup matches).

## How It Compounds

```
Daily work → daily log
  → nightly distill → routes to project/tools/infra/principles files
                     → optimization pass (dedup, prune stale, condense)
  → weekly synthesis → patterns, recurring problems, unfinished threads
Sub-agent work → debrief (P6) → daily log → same pipeline
Decisions → captured with reasoning (P5) → never re-asked
New tools → documented with abilities (P4) → findable by intent
```

Each day the agent wakes up slightly more knowledgeable and better organized.
